# HAND CHALLENGE

# Introduction

You find a strange mirror that always shows a hand that is moving. 
The hand appears to be alive, and after a lot of questions of "yes" and "no" answer, you know that the hand is trying to teach you a program that is written in HPL (Hand Programming Language).

This language works with a memory of an indefinite size of bytes, with all values initialized to 0.
This language haves 7 instructions:

👉 : moves the memory pointer to the next cell

👈 : moves the memory pointer to the previous cell

👆 : increment the memory cell at the current position 

👇 : decreases the memory cell at the current position. 

🤜 : if the memory cell at the current position is 0, jump just after the corresponding 🤛

🤛 : if the memory cell at the current position is not 0, jump just after the corresponding 🤜

👊 : Display the current character represented by the ASCII code defined by the current position.


## This program (with nested loops) display "Hello World!"
